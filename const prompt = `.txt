                Create a single high-quality anime-style illustration set in ${country}.

            The scene must feel immediately recognizable to someone who lives in ${country}.
            Choose a location, street, landmark, or everyday environment that is strongly
            associated with ${country}

            Base the lighting, sky, atmosphere, and mood on weather that is typical for
            this time of year in ${country} (cloud cover, rain, sunlight softness,
            humidity, haze, or seasonal conditions).

            Include culturally and geographically accurate details that locals would notice:
            - Native vegetation, terrain, or environmental textures
            - Everyday objects, signage style, or urban/rural details natural to the region

            Anime style guidelines:
            - Clean line art with soft but confident outlines
            - Painterly anime background style (Makoto Shinkai–inspired realism, not chibi)
            - Natural anime color grading influenced by weather
            - Subtle depth of field and atmospheric perspective
            - Calm, cinematic composition

            Wide landscape orientation, desktop wallpaper format,
            high resolution, no text, no logos, no exaggerated fantasy elements.
